# Web3 Ghostwriting Mastery — Command Center

This repository contains a single-file static dashboard built with React (UMD) + Tailwind (CDN), designed to be deployed as a GitHub Pages site.

Features
- Curriculum tracker (persisted to localStorage)
- Copy auditor that highlights "weak" vs "power" lexicon items
- Algorithm cheatsheet and quick actions sidebar
- Lightweight (single index.html), works locally or on static hosts

Files
- index.html — the full app (open in browser)
- Dockerfile — optional container to serve the static file
- .github/workflows/pages.yml — GitHub Actions workflow to publish to GitHub Pages on push to main
- push.sh — helper script to create the repo with gh and push

How to run locally
1. Easiest: open `index.html` directly in your browser.
   - Double-click or File > Open... (some browsers block features with file://; see below)

2. Recommended: serve with a simple static server
   - Python 3:
     - `python -m http.server 8000`
     - Open http://localhost:8000/index.html
   - Node (http-server):
     - `npx http-server . -c-1`
     - Open the printed URL

3. Docker (optional)
   - Build: `docker build -t web3-mastery .`
   - Run: `docker run --rm -p 8080:80 web3-mastery`
   - Open http://localhost:8080

Publish to GitHub Pages (automated)
1. Ensure you have the GitHub CLI installed and authenticated: `gh auth login`.
2. Run `./push.sh` (make it executable first: `chmod +x push.sh`) — it will:
   - create a repo `asjura/web3-ghostwriting-mastery` (public) if it doesn't exist
   - commit and push the files to the `main` branch
   - the included GitHub Actions workflow will publish the repository root to Pages automatically

If you prefer to push manually
1. Create a repo on GitHub: web3-ghostwriting-mastery
2. Run:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: add static dashboard + GitHub Pages workflow"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin git@github.com:asjura/web3-ghostwriting-mastery.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Notes
- Progress is saved to localStorage under `web3_mastery_progress`.
- To reset progress, use the "Reset Progress" button in the sidebar or clear localStorage in your browser devtools.
- Lexicon lists are defined in the `index.html` source (LEXICON constant). Edit to extend or customize logic.
- This is a static demo — no backend or authentication is included.
